<h1 align="center">Appendix for Heuristics for Bounded-Suboptimal Search </h1>

This appendix includes all tables for all domains, heuristics and epsilon values, averaged over all instances, which
appeared in the paper.

If at least one instance fails, we report the number of instances solved (denoted as \#X, where X represents the number
of instances solved) instead of the average number of expansions and solution quality.
